# Part 3: EcmaScript 5 for AngularJS Developers

JavaScript is an untyped, interpreted programming language that can accomodate
a variety of  programming paradigms. Among other things, a lot of modern
JavaScript code heavily leverages functional programming style. The
combination of weak typing and functional methods can make JavaScript code a
bit hard to understand for those coming from strongly typed object-oriented
languages such as  Java.

This module is intended for an audience who is new to JavaScript, or one that
simply needs a refresher. We will walk through the basic JavaScript
constructs that make up an AngularJS application.

Let's begin by dissecting the following example of AngularJS code:

```javascript
  angular.module('ngcourse')

  .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.username = 'alice';
    $scope.numberOfTasks = 0;
  });
```

This code defines an AngularJS controller called `MainCtrl` as a part of a
module `ngcourse`. The way it does it may seem counterintuitive at first.

##Function Chaining / Fluent interfaces

If we look at files that make up an AngularJS application, a typical file
would often consist of a single giant JavaScript statement where multiple
method calls are chained together: we call a method on an object, get another
object, then call a method on that object, get another method, etc. JavaScript
allows us to insert white space before the `.` that precedes a method
invocation, so this:

In the example above,

```javascript
  angular.module('ngcourse')

  .controller(...);
```

is really equivalent to this:

```javascript
  angular.module('ngcourse').controller(...);
```

To support this `fluent` programming style, Angular ensures that methods such
as `.controller()` return the object to which the method belongs. This allows
us to define another controller after the first one, while still working with
the same expression:

```javascript
  angular.module('ngcourse')

  .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope) {
    ...
  })

  .controller('TaskListCtrl', function($scope) {
    ...
  });
```

To understand what is happening here, let's consider an alternative style
where we actually save the objects in variables:

```javascript
  var ngCourseModule  = angular.module('ngcourse');

  ngCourseModule.controller('MainCtrl', function($scope){ ... });

  ngCourseModule.controller('TaskListCtrl', function($scope){ ... });
```

Note that the return value of `ngCourseModule.controller()` is the same object
as `ngCourseModule`.

This style may seem more intuitive to those coming to JavaScript from other
languages. There is a reason, however, why we do not use this style. The
example above defines a new variable `ngCourseModule`. Unfortunately, a
variable defined outside of a function becomes _global_ in JavaScript. We'll
come back to global variables and ways to avoid them in a short while.

For now, however, let's note that chained method calls provide us with a way to
avoid defining new variables. We will see this pattern often in AngularJS
applications, for example when defining services or directives.

## JavaScript Functions

To define a controller we call module's `.controller` method with two
arguments. The first is the name of the controller, the second one is a
function that implements it:

```javascript
  angular.module('ngcourse')
  .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope) {...});
```

In languages such as Java, arguments to functions and methods can be objects
or primitives, but not functions. In JavaScript, however, functions are first
class citizens. A function can be passed into another function as a parameter.
A function can return a function. Functions can also be assigned to variables.

JavaScript allows two ways of defining a function. In the first method, called
"function declaration", a new function is defined in the current
scope and is given a name:

```javascript
  function foo() {
    // do something
  }
```

We will be able to refer to this function as `foo` in the current scope. It is
worth noting that functions defined using function declarations are "hoisted"
in JavaScript. Regardless of where you define a function in the current scope,
JavaScript would act as if the function was defined up front. So, this is
perfectly valid:

```javascript
  // Call a function.
  foo();

  // Now provide a definition.
  function foo() {
    // do something
  }
```

An alternative method of defining a function is a "function expression". In
this case, provide a function definition in a context where JavaScript would
expect to see an expression:

```javascript
  var foo = function foo() {
    // do something
  }
```

Functions defined this way are _not_ hoisted, so this would be invalid:

```javascript
  // This call will fail because the value of "foo" is undefined at this point.
  foo();

  // The function is defined, but it's too late.
  var foo = function foo() {
    // do something
  }
```

Functions defined as function expressions do not need to have names:

```javascript
  var foo = function() {
    // do something
  }
```

If we do provide a name in a function expression, we won't be able to call the
function by this name, but the function will use name when reporting errors.

```javascript
  var foo = function bar() {
    // This function thinks it's called "bar" and will use this name when
    // reporting errors. We cannot call it by this name, however.
  }

  bar(); // This will fail.
```

In our case of defining an Angular controller, we use a function expression to define an anonymous function and then pass it as the second argument argument to `controller()`:

```javascript
  .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope) {
    ...
  })
```

## Variable Scope

In JavaScript, variables are _global_ unless declared inside a function.
Global variables can make code very hard to debug and maintain, so you must
always be careful not to create them unintentionally.

The only way to create local variables in JavaScript is to define them inside
a function. Doing so, however, requires defining a function. If we were to use
a function declaration, we would end up poluting the global name space with
the function itself.

Consider this example:

```javascript
  function foo() {
    var bar = 1;
    // do something with bar;
  }
```

Here we succeeded in making `bar` local, but we created a global function `foo()`!

We can solve this "catch-22" situation by using a function expression:

```javascript
  (function() {
    var bar = 1;
    // do something with bar;
  })();
```

Here we defined `bar` inside an _anonymous_ function that we call right away.
This pattern is very common in JavaScript and is called "a immediately-invoked
function expression" or "IIFE". We do _not_ usually use this style in
AngularJS, however. Instead, we normally rely on functions that we define as
arguments to module methods:

```javascript
  .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope) {
    var bar = 1; // This will be local to this function.
    ...
  })
```

It is worth noting that unlike some languages, JavaScript does not support
"lexical scoping": variable are defined at the level of a function, not a
block. (This is being fixed in ES6 with the keyword "let".)

## Nested Scopes

In JavaScript, a function can be declared within another function.  The
function has a local (function) scope, it has access to the scope of the outer
function, and it also has access to a global scope.

Here is a pure JavaScript example with multiple scopes:

```javascript
  var x = 1;
  var y = 2;

  console.log('in global scope: ', x, y);

  function func() {
    var x = 2;
    y = 2;
    console.log('in func(): ', x, y);

    function innerFunc() {
      var x = 3;
      y = 3;
      console.log('in innerFunc(): ', x, y);
    }
    innerFunc();

    console.log('in func() again: ', x, y);
  };
  func();  
  console.log('in global scope again: ', x, y);
```
Executing the code above will produce the following:

```
  in global scope:  1 2
  in func():  2 2
  in innerFunc():  3 3
  in func() again:  2 3
  in global scope again:  1 3
```

Notice that here we declare `x` again in each scope. This makes `x` act as
different variables in different scopes. Changing the value of `x` in inner
scopes does not affect its value in the outer scopes.

For `y`, the behavior is quite different. We do not declare it again in the
nested scopes, which means the outer scope's variable is used. Setting the
value of `y` inside a nested scope changes its value in the outer scope.
