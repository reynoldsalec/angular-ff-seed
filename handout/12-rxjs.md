# Part 12: Reactive Programming with RxJs.

In chapters 8 and 10, we have seen on how to deal with asynchronicity within your application by using callbacks and promises, this chapter will focus on the concept of Observable that provide a paradigm for dealing with asynchronous data streams.

## What is Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams represented by Observables. The concept here is a mix of Observer and Iterable design patterns. Specifically, observable can be conceptualized as an immutable collection of data ordered in time, and iterated over similarly to collections such as arrays or lists.

## Creating an Observable from Scratch

First let's jump into a basic example to illustrate the concepts behinds RxJS observables.

```javascript
  let source = Rx.Observable.create(observer => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      observer.onNext(42);
      observer.onCompleted();
    }, 2000);
    
    console.log('Starting Observable Sequence!');
  });

  let subscription = source.subscribe(
    value => console.log('Value: ' + value),
    error => console.log(error),
    () => console.log('Completed Observable Sequence!')
  );
```

First, we create an observable sequence `source`. This sequence emits a single value asynchronously using `setTimeout()` and then completes.

The second part of the code subscribes to the observable sequence `source`, and provides an *Observer* represented by the 3 callbacks provided. Those callbacks are:

1. `onNext`: represents a function to be invoked when a new value is emitted onto an observable sequence `source`.
2. `onError`: represents a function to be invoked if an error occurs within an observable sequence.
3. `onComplete`: represents a function to be invoked when the observable sequence completes.

### Handling Errors

So far we created a basic observable example and attached the `onError` callback. Let's see how it can be put to better use.

```javascript
  let source = Rx.Observable.create(observer => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      try {
        //throw 'My Error';
        observer.onNext(42);
        observer.onCompleted();
      } 
      catch (error) {
        observer.onError(error);
      }
    }, 2000);
    
    console.log('Starting Observable Sequence!');
  });

  let subscription = source.subscribe(
    value => console.log('Value: ' + value),
    error => console.log(error),
    () => console.log('Completed Observable Sequence!')
  );
```

Running the above example without the `try...catch` and throwing an error will produce an uncaught error. Adding the try catch and handling the error by using the `onError` method allows us to emit the error via an observable and propagate it properly to the observer end.

### Disposing Subscriptions

In some cases we might want to unsubscribe early from our observable. To achieve that we need to dispose of our subscription. Luckily, our call to `subscribe` on our observable actually returns an instance of a `Disposable`. This allows us to call `dispose` on our subscription should we decide to stop listening.

When we call `dispose` method on our subscription, our observer will stop listening to observable for data. In addition, we can return a function within our observable's implementation (i.e. `create` method above) that will be invoked when we call the `dispose` method on our subscription. This is useful for any kind of clean-up that might be required. 

Let's modify our example and see how it works out.

```javascript
  let source = Rx.Observable.create(observer => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      try {
        
        console.log('In Timeout!');
        
        observer.onNext(42);
        observer.onCompleted();
      } 
      catch (error) {
        observer.onError(error);
      }
    }, 2000);
    
    console.log('Starting Observable Sequence!');
    
    return onDispose = () => console.log('Stoping to Listen to this Observable Sequence');
    
  });

  let subscription = source.subscribe(
    value => console.log('Value: ' + value),
    error => console.log(error),
    () => console.log('Completed Observable Sequence!')
  );

  setTimeout(() => subscription.dispose(), 1000);
```

The last line of the code above, calls `dispose` method on our subscription after 1000ms (our observable is supposed to emit after 2000ms). If you run this example you will notice that this observable did not emit any values since we have called `dispose` method.

In most of the cases we will not need to explicitly call the `dispose` method on our subscription unless we want to cancel early or our observable has a longer life span than our subscription. The default behaviour of an observable operators is to dispose of the subscription as soon as `onCompleted` or `onError` messages are published. Keep in mind that RxJS was designed to be used in a "fire and forget" fashion most of the time. 

### Releasing Resources

Note, however that our log statement within `setTimeout` was still called. This implies that even though our subscription was disposed of, the code within the `setTimeout` was still executed. All that we achieved is that no values were emitted onto for the observer to see, but our code block was still put on the even queue to be executed. In other words we did not release our resources properly which is the main use of the function we are returning in our `create` block. We are half way there.

The correct implementation in this case would be to cancel the timeout instead, like so.

```javascript
  let source = Rx.Observable.create(observer => {
    let timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      try {
        
        console.log('In Timeout!');
        
        observer.onNext(42);
        observer.onCompleted();
      } 
      catch (error) {
        observer.onError(error);
      }
    }, 2000);
    
    console.log('Starting Observable Sequence!');
    
    return onDispose = () => {
      console.log('Releasing Resources of this Observable Sequence');
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    };
    
  });

  let subscription = source.subscribe(
    value => console.log('Value: ' + value),
    error => console.log(error),
    () => console.log('Completed Observable Sequence!')
  );

  setTimeout(() => subscription.dispose(), 1000);
```

## Observables vs. Promises

Both promises and observables provide us with abstractions that help us deal with the asynchronous nature of our applications. However, there are important differences between the two. 

1. As seen in the example above, observables can define both the setup and teardown aspects of asynchronous behaviour. Observables are cancellable.
2. Moreover, Observables can be retried using one of the retry operators provided by the API, such as `retry` and `retryWhen`. On the other hand in the case of promises, the caller must have access to the original function that returned the promise in order to have a retry capability.

## Creating Observable Sequences

In the example above we have been creating observables from scratch which is especially useful in understanding the anatomy of an observable. 

However, a lot of the times we will create observables from callbacks, promises, events, collections or using many of the operators available on the API.

Now that we got the anatomy and structure of observables understood, let's look at some of the many other ways to create observables.

### `interval` and `take`

```javascript
  Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(5).subscribe(
    element => console.info(element),
    error => console.info(error),
    () => console.info('I am done!')
  );
```

The observable above will produce a value every 1000ms, only the first 5 values will be emitted due to the use of `take`, otherwise the sequence will emit values indefinitely. There are many more operators available within the API, such as `range`, `timer` etc.

### `fromArray`

```javascript
  Rx.Observable.fromArray([1, 2, 3]).subscribe(
    element => console.info(element),
    error => console.info(error),
    () => console.info('I am done!')
  );
```

### `fromPromise`

```javascript
  let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => resolve(42));

  Rx.Observable.fromPromise(promise)
    .subscribe((value) => console.log(value));
```

### `fromEvent`

```javascript
  Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click').subscribe(
    clickEvent => console.info(
      clickEvent.clientX + ', ' + clickEvent.clientY
    )
  );
```

The first line in the example above creates an observable of mouse click events on our document, ordered in time. Another way to refer to an observable is to call it an asynchronous collection.

**The point to take home from this, is that EVERYTHING can be made into a stream using observables.**

## Using Observables Array Style

In addition to simply iterating over an asynchronous collection, we can perform other operations such as `filter` or `map` and many more as defined in RxJS [a API](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS). This is what bridges observable with the Iterable pattern, and lets us conceptualize them as collections.

Let's expand our example and do something a little more with our stream:

```javascript
  Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click')
    .filter(clickEvent: MouseEvent => clickEvent.altKey)
    .subscribe(clickEvent: MouseEvent => console.info(
      clickEvent.clientX + ', ' + clickEvent.clientY
    )
  );
```

Note the chaining function style, and the optional static typing that comes with TypeScript we have used in this example.

**Most Importantly** functions like `filter` return an observable, as in *observables beget other observables*, similarly to promises.

## Asynchronous Requests Using Observables

A lot of the time the asynchronous nature of our application will surface when dealing with UI events as illustrated in examples above, or making asynchronous server requests. Observables are well equipped to deal with both.

We have already seen the code below in Chapter 6 about REST APIs.

```javascript

  this.$http.get('http://ngcourse.herokuapp.com/api/v1/tasks')
    .then((response) => {
      this.$log.info(response.data);
      this.tasks = response.data;
    })
    .then(null, 
      (error) => this.$log.error(status, error));

```

Let's see how we can make an asynchronous server call using an Observable instead.

```javascript
  let responseStream = Rx.Observable.create(observer => {
    $http.get('http://ngcourse.herokuapp.com/api/v1/tasks')
      .then(response => observer.onNext(response))
      .then(null, error => observer.onError(error));
  });
  
  responseStream.subscribe(
    (response) => $log.info('Data: ', response),
    (error) => $log.info('Error: ', error)
  );
```

In the code snippet above we are creating a custom response data stream, and notifying the observers of the stream when the data arrived.

```javascript
  let responseStream = Rx.Observable.fromPromise(
    $http.get('http://ngcourse.herokuapp.com/api/v1/tasks'));
    
  responseStream.subscribe(
    (response) => $log.info('Data: ', response),
    (error) => $log.info('Error: ', error)
  );
```

## Combining Streams with `flatMap`

We want to make something a bit more useful and attach our server request to a button click. How can that be done with streams? Let's observe the example below.

```javascript
  let eventStream = 
    Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document.getElementById('refreshBtn'), 'click');
    
  let responseStream = eventStream  
    .flatMap(() => Rx.Observable.fromPromise(
      $http.get('http://ngcourse.herokuapp.com/api/v1/tasks')));

  responseStream.subscribe(
    (response) => $log.info('Async Data: ', response),
    (error) => $log.info('Async Error: ', error)
  );
```

First we create an observable of button click events on some button. Then we use the `flatMap` function to transform our event stream into our response stream.

Note that `flatMap` flattens a stream of observables (i.e observable of observables) to a stream of emitted values (a simple observable), by emitting on the "trunk" stream everything that will be emitted on "branch" streams.

Alternatively, if we were to use `map` instead, we would create a meta stream, i.e. a stream of stream.

```javascript
  ...      
  let metaStream = eventStream  
    .map(() => Rx.Observable.fromPromise(
      $http.get('http://ngcourse.herokuapp.com/api/v1/tasks')));

  // We would have to subscribe to each stream received below
  // to achieve the behaviour we want
  metaStream.subscribe(
    (stream) => $log.info('Async Data: ', stream),
    (error) => $log.info('Async Error: ', error)
  );
```

This is not very useful in our current example as we would have to subscribe to an observable received from an observable stream. 

## Cold vs. Hot Observables

Observables in RxJS can be classified into 2 main groups, Hot and Cold Observables. Let's start with a cold observables

```javascript
  let source = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(7);

  setTimeout(() => {
    source.subscribe(
      value => console.log('subscription A: ' + value));
  }, 0);

  setTimeout(() => {
    source.subscribe(
      value => console.log('   subscription B: ' + value));
  }, 2000);
```

In the above case subscriber B subscribes 2000ms after subscriber A. Yet subscriber B is starting to get the value from 0 to 6 just like subscriber A only time shifted. This behaviour is referred to as a **Cold Observable**. A useful analogy is watching a pre-recorded video, let's stay on Netflix. You press play and the movie starts playing from the beginning. Someone else, can start playing the same movie in their own home 25 minutes later.

On the other hand there is also a **Hot Observable**, which is more like a live performance. You attend a live band performance from the beginning, but someone else might be 25 minutes late to the show. The band will not start playing from the beginning and you have to start watching the performance from where it is. 

We have already encountered both kind of observables, the example above is a cold observable, while an example that uses `fromEvent` on our mouse clicks is a hot observable.

### Converting from Cold to Hot Observables

A useful method within RxJS API, is the `publish` method. This method takes in a cold observable as it's source and returns an instance of a `ConnectableObservable`. In this case we will have to explicitly call `connect` on our hot observable to start broadcasting values to its subscribers.

```javascript
  let source = 
      Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(7).publish();

  setTimeout(() => {
    source.connect();
  }, 1000);

  setTimeout(() => {
    source.subscribe(
      value => console.log('subscription A: ' + value));
  }, 0);

  setTimeout(() => {
    source.subscribe(
      value => console.log('   subscription B: ' + value));
  }, 5000);
```

In the case above, the live performance starts at 1000ms, subscriber A arrived to the concert hall 1000ms early to get a good seat, and our subscriber B arrived to the performance 4000ms late and missed a bunch of songs.

Another useful method to work with hot observables instead of `connect` is `refCount`. This is auto connect method, that will start broadcasting as soon as there are more than one subscriber. Analogously, it will stop if the number of subscribers goes to 0, in other words no performance will happen if there is no one in the audience.

## Summary

RxJS is a flexible set of APIs for composing and transforming asynchronous streams. It provides multitude of function to create stream from absolutely anything and more to manipulate and transform them..
